# SimpleBingo-
This is a simple bingo game for streamers and content creators. You can choose to display 1 - 10 squares, add as many points as you like in the text field, and then generate a random bingo card with completed points that you can mark off.
Yes, it's that easy.

For transparency:
I wanted to create a bingo game like this for myself but couldn't find anything, so I turned to Chat GPT and ultimately this program was created. So, in this case, about 90% of the code was written by Chat GPT.
Since I find it very practical in its current form, I wanted to make it available to everyone.

**HOW TO USE:**

Within the text field, you can enter as many keywords or short phrases for your bingo card as you like. These should always be separated by a ",".
When you click "Update Text," the text you entered will be transferred to the bingo squares. Every time you press "Shuffle," the card will be regenerated based on the existing text.

If you want to save your text for later or load a different one, you can do so using the "Save" and "Load" buttons.
This way, you can create as many bingo cards as you want.

The rest of the buttons should be self-explanatory.

**OBS SETTINGS**

To integrate the program into OBS, go to Sources and then add > Window Capture > Create new (name it as you like) and select "SimpleBingo."

Right-click on the created window capture and choose Filters > Add > Color Key > Custom color > Select color.

Now, you can use "Pick Screen Color" to select and cut out the blue color range of the program or alternatively, enter the hex code #add8e6.
Afterward, you can crop the window capture as per your preferences.

If you have any difficulties or have ideas/requests for improving the program, feel free to contact me.
