# SimpleBingo-
This is a simple bingo game for streamers and content creators. You can choose to display 1 - 10 squares, add as many points as you like in the text field, and then generate a random bingo card with completed points that you can mark off.
Yes, it's that easy.

For transparency:
I wanted to create a bingo game like this for myself but couldn't find anything, so I turned to Chat GPT and ultimately this program was created. So, in this case, about 90% of the code was written by Chat GPT.
Since I find it very practical in its current form, I wanted to make it available to everyone.
